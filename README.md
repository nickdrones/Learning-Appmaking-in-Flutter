# First Test of an App in Flutter

I've never worked in Flutter before so this is a learning experience for me. It seems pretty intuitive and easy!

## Getting Started

So far, all this app does is use a third-party plugin to read the device's MAC address, then create an MD5 hash of the MAC address to use as a unique device identifier. Finally, it reads and prints the device's current GPS coordinates. More will be coming soon!

## Plugins Used
- get_mac 0.0.1
- crypto 2.1.5
- location 3.0.2
- wifi_info_plugin 1.0.6
